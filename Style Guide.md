## Our Header Styles:

# Our Titles Will Be Header 1
## Our Main Sections Will Be Header 2
### Subheading will be Header 3, 4,... as appropriate
The way we to create a Headers in Markdown is using the **``"#"``** symbol. For Header 1 it will be a single ``#`` in front of our Titles. Inside of Markdown, each additional ``#`` symbol creates a smaller header up to 6. 

## Our List Styles:
- Unordered lists will be bullet points
	- With sub bullets being tabbed over

1. Ordered list will be numbers
	1. With sub bullets also being numbers and tabbed over

## Our Code Block Style:
In Markdown there are two ways to format code blocks. The two ways would be indenting the entirety of the code by four spaces or using three backticks before and after the code block. For our documentation for all code blocks we will be using the three \``` before and after the code.
