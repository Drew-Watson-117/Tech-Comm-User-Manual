## Our Header Styles:

# Our Titles Will Be Header 1
## Our Main Sections Will Be Header 2
### Subheading will be Header 3, 4,... as appropriate
The way we to create a Headers in Markdown is using the **``"#"``** symbol. For Header 1 it will be a single ``#`` in front of our Titles. Inside of Markdown, each additional ``#`` symbol creates a smaller header up to 6. 

## Our List Styles:
- Unordered lists will be bullet points
	- With sub bullets being tabbed over

1. Ordered list will be numbers
	1. With sub bullets also being numbers and tabbed over

## Our Code Block Style:
In Markdown there are two ways to format code blocks. The two ways would be indenting the entirety of the code by four spaces or using three backticks before and after the code block. For our documentation for all code blocks we will be using the three \``` before and after the code.

images, margins, voice and style, formal

Images in our style guide will include alterante text for screen readers and other accsesibility features. Images will include a 10 dp padding margin to offset any elements that surround our image. Images will also be formatted to stlye around text and not be large enough to override page dimensions like height and width. 

For any document links, the style guide specifies they must be imbedded into text that most cosley corresponds with information about the link. (Example - "There is more info *[here](https://github.com/Drew-Watson-117/Tech-Comm-User-Manual/blob/master/Style%20Guide.md)*)" 

Emails will also follow the same format as links but when clicked upon, prompt the user to send an email to the selected email. (Example - "This is my *[email](mailto:dummyemail@email.com)*."

For any long quote passages potentially referencing academic sources, our style guide will use blockquotes. Blockquotes will offset text to indicate a quote and distinuish the text from the rest of the document. Example -> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

To indicate any mathematical symbols the style guide will use the code formatting from markdown and use the built in math notatation for mathematical operations.
