# Markdown
Markdown is a light markup language. It enables easy and quick formatting of headers, lists, and text formatting. It is an alternative to systems such as Word and Latex. In Markdown we use symbles around text to denote heades, bolding, or lists. This creates a system that is faster to create and edit than Word and less complex than Latex. It is also able to be converted into HTML and PDF's with ease. Because of these reasons it will be used as the editor for the manual. This also provides us with our baseline styling.

We will be using the default options that come in Markdown. This controls the font size, spacing and the color. While these could be changed, it provides us with a strong base line. The font that is used in Markdown is Noto Sans with black text (#000000) on white background to maintain a professional look. Markdown also controls the heading, subheading, and body text. A ```#``` is used to change the text to headers. The largest challenge with Markdown will be the page numbers and the table of contents. Pandoc will be used to generate these for use. This means each chapter must be its own seperate Markdown file so it can be generated into a PDF at the end.
